> **A complete customer analytics project demonstrating the full pipeline — from descriptive insights to predictive models and ROI-driven retention strategies.**

**By:** Abdulrahman Badry | Data Analyst & BI Specialist  
**Role:** *Sole Analyst (end-to-end: data cleaning → modeling → business recommendations)*  
**Project Duration:** October 2025  
**Dataset:** Brazilian E-Commerce (Olist) – 93K+ customers, 96K+ orders

---

## 📌 About This Project
- Analyzed **93K+ customers & 96K orders** to uncover churn drivers and retention opportunities.  
- Built a **4-phase analytics pipeline**: Descriptive (RFM & CLV) → Diagnostic (Cohorts & Churn) → Predictive (ML Models) → Prescriptive (ROI-based strategies).  
- Delivered **business-ready outputs**: customer segments, churn predictions, executive dashboards, and ROI-driven interventions (projected **R$1.1–2.3M revenue protection**).

---

## ⚡ TL;DR
This project shows how advanced analytics can **save millions in at-risk revenue** by identifying churn, predicting high-risk customers, and recommending ROI-focused retention actions.  
It combines **data engineering, analytics, ML, and business storytelling** into a single portfolio case study.

---

## 🔍 Analysis Phases (Case Study Style)

### 1️⃣ Descriptive Analytics — *What happened?*
- Segmented **93K customers** with RFM (9 groups).  
- Found **59% churn rate** and **3% repeat purchase rate**.  
- Calculated **Avg CLV ≈ R$180 per customer (VIPs >R$5K)**.  
*Outputs:* `rfm_analysis_results.csv`, `segment_summary.csv`

### 2️⃣ Diagnostic Analytics — *Why did it happen?*
- Churn defined as **180+ days inactivity**.  
- Cohort analysis: **99.7% drop-off** within 3 months.  
- “At Risk” segment → **100% churn**.  
*Outputs:* `churn_analysis_results.csv`, `cohort_retention_matrix.csv`

### 3️⃣ Predictive Analytics — *What will happen?*
- Built multiple models → **Logistic Regression selected** (73.85% accuracy, F1 84.9%).  
- **Top churn drivers:** monetary value, engagement, days between purchases, avg order value, frequency.  
- Predicted **30,475 high-risk customers** (~R$5.7M CLV at risk).  
*Outputs:* `churn_predictions_improved.csv`, `priority_intervention_list.csv`

### 4️⃣ Prescriptive Analytics — *What should we do?*
- **Critical outreach**: 225 VIPs (ROI 8:1).  
- **Automated campaigns**: 30K high-risk customers (ROI 15:1).  
- **Programs**: loyalty, win-back, VIP experience.  
*Deliverables:* Executive summary, technical docs, action plan
